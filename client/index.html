	<h1>How to Play</h1>
	<p>
		Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is relatively simple. You draw a Tic-Tac-Toe board, and draw another
		Tic-Tac-Toe board in each of the cells! And, just like in normal Tic-Tac-Toe, your goal is to
		get a 3-in-a-row.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each player can only directly place into the smallest level cells, and earn the higher-level
		boards by winning them! Easy, right?
	</p>
	<p>
		But there is one catch! When you make a move, your opponent is sent to another board relatively
		to where you placed your piece.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the example below, X played her first move in the bottom-left of a mini-board. O's next turn
		is then restricted to only being within the bottom-left board!
	</p>

	<p>
		This means that the most important aspect of your turn might not be where your piece goes, but
		where your opponent can go next!
	</p>

	<p>
		One thing to note for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, sending your opponent to a board that's already been
		claimed lets them go anywhere in the next level above that board! This makes games end much
		faster than they start, as it gets harder and harder to avoid giving your opponent the
		opportunity to go anywhere they'd like!
	</p>

	<h1>Ultimate ULTIMATE Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>

	<p>
		If you want to play Ultimate Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, there's one more thing to note! Winning a
		mini-board does exactly what happens in UTTT: your opponent is sent to that board. But, because
		there's more than 2 layers here, they get sent
		to the mini-board relative to the *cell* you played to get the win as well!
	</p>

	<p>
		The gif below begins zoomed in on the top-centre board before X has her turn. When she wins the small
		<i>right-centre</i> board by placing her piece in the <i>top-right</i> cell, we zoom out to the rest of
		the board.
	</p>

	<p>
		Her opponent must then play in the <i>right-centre</i> UTTT board, in the <i>top-right</i> TTT board.
		Play would then continue in the right-centre board until another board is won.
	</p>
